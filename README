This repository contains source directories that OPSI packages may be generated out of. Each directory should contain CLIENT_DATA/, OPSI/ directories, and optionally, SERVER_DATA/.

When creating a new product you should make a copy of the newproduct-template directory, and edit those files appropriately.

New packages REQUIRE review before being checked in.
